## Repo Purpose: Examples of storing data in different languages
The aim of this repository is to go beyond traditional standards and databases. <br>Disclaimer, not sure how often I will update the project. 
<br>

# Steps taken
<pre>
1) recently, first step to solve the problem; started learning core data in swift
that its use is for large amounts of information and learned what to use for smaller information sizes.
core data supposedly can be used for local storage and remote storage.

## Preliminary thoughts on the challenge of the project.
Storing in a centralized location seems standard. 
Many of my projects I have in mind need to store information 
locally either with cookies in the browser
or secondary storage on the phone. 

Persisting information on the user side. 
by databases
or by files
or by cookies
or in the cache

when does one make the distinction for stored by the user? 
to stored in the database?
to stored in a centralized database?

## These decisions should be in the build notes of every project.
